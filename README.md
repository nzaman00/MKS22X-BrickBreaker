# MKS22X-BrickBreaker
## 5/20: 
Made the platform class, got it to move properly. The platform class moves along with the mouse, but if it reaches the walls, it does not move further.
## 5/21:
Made ball class and got it to bounce off the walls as if it was a real ball, but it does not bounce off the platform
## 5/22:
Got the ball class to bounce off the platform when they collide
## 5/23:
Fixed ball class to bounce when hit diagonally by the platform, but it does not move realistically. Fixed the bug where the ball keeps bouncing even after it falls off.
## 5/24:
Fixed the ball class so that the Xspeed of the ball changes depending on where the ball hits the platform. The closer to the middle, the steadier it moves.
## 5/27:
Made brick class constructor, but it does not collide yet. I changed the background temporarily to white so it's easier to see the bricks while I test everything
